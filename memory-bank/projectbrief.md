# PlanetForge - Civilization IV Map Generator Project Brief

## Project Overview

PlanetForge is a sophisticated map generation script for Civilization IV that creates realistic, earth-like worlds using plate tectonics and climate modeling. This project aims to produce natural, organic maps that maintain gameplay balance while achieving geological and climatic realism.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goals

1. **Realistic World Generation**: Use plate tectonic simulation to create natural continental shapes and mountain ranges
2. **Climate Modeling**: Implement latitude-based climate zones for appropriate terrain and biome placement
3. **Natural Features**: Generate rivers that flow downhill, realistic resource distribution, and logical biome transitions
4. **Gameplay Balance**: Ensure generated maps provide fair starting positions and balanced gameplay
5. **Performance**: Generate maps within reasonable time constraints for various world sizes

### Technical Requirements

- **Platform**: Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword Python API
- **Language**: Python 2.4+ (Civ IV compatible)
- **Architecture**: Single file map script (`PlanetForge.py`)
- **Interface**: Must implement CvMapScriptInterface functions
- **Compatibility**: Work with all standard Civ IV world sizes and game options

### Key Features

- Plate tectonic simulation for continental formation
- Climate-based terrain and feature placement
- Natural river systems following elevation gradients
- Realistic resource distribution based on geological processes
- Balanced starting position algorithms
- Support for standard Civ IV climate and sea level options

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success

- Generates playable maps for all world sizes
- Creates visually appealing, natural-looking continents
- Provides balanced starting positions for all civilizations
- Maintains reasonable generation times (< 30 seconds for standard maps)

### Quality Success

- Maps feel organic and earth-like rather than artificial
- Terrain transitions are logical and realistic
- Resource placement follows geological principles
- Rivers and mountain ranges appear natural

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- Core map generation using plate tectonics
- Climate-based terrain placement
- Natural river generation
- Balanced resource distribution
- Standard Civ IV integration

### Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)

- Custom civilizations or units
- Scenario-specific features
- Advanced UI customization beyond standard map options
- Multiplayer-specific optimizations

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation

- Project structure setup ✅
- Basic map script framework ✅
- Placeholder implementations ✅

### Phase 2: Core Systems

- Plate tectonic simulation implementation
- Basic continental generation
- Elevation and plot type assignment

### Phase 3: Climate & Terrain

- Climate zone calculation
- Terrain type assignment based on climate
- Feature placement (forests, jungles, etc.)

### Phase 4: Natural Features

- River generation following elevation
- Resource placement using geological principles
- Starting position balancing

### Phase 5: Polish & Balance

- Performance optimization
- Gameplay balance testing
- Visual refinement

## Constraints & Considerations

### Technical Constraints

- Must work within Civ IV's Python 2.4 environment
- Limited to CvPythonExtensions API
- Single file architecture requirement
- Memory and performance limitations of the game engine

### Design Constraints

- Must maintain Civ IV gameplay balance
- Should feel familiar to Civ IV players
- Cannot break existing game mechanics
- Must work with all standard game options

## Key Stakeholders

- **Primary User**: Civilization IV players seeking more realistic maps
- **Developer**: Project maintainer and algorithm implementer
- **Community**: Civ IV modding community for feedback and testing
