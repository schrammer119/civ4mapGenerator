# Active Context - Current Development State

## Current Focus

### Project Phase: Foundation Complete ✅

We have successfully completed Phase 1 of the PlanetForge development:

- Project structure established
- Development environment configured
- Basic map script framework implemented
- Memory bank and documentation created

### Next Phase: Core Systems Implementation

Moving into Phase 2 - implementing the core plate tectonic simulation and continental generation systems.

## Recent Changes

### Project Setup (Completed)

1. **Directory Structure**: Created clean, organized project layout

   - `.clinerules/` for development guidelines
   - `memory-bank/` for project context and documentation
   - `tests/` for testing utilities
   - `examples/` for reference materials (git ignored)

2. **Core Files Created**:

   - `PlanetForge.py`: Main map script with placeholder implementations
   - `.gitignore`: Comprehensive ignore rules including examples/
   - `README.md`: Project documentation and usage instructions
   - `requirements.txt`: Dependencies documentation

3. **Development Support**:
   - Cline rules established for Civ IV development patterns
   - Memory bank structure implemented
   - Testing framework prepared with dummy API

### Current Code State

The `PlanetForge.py` file contains:

- ✅ Basic CvMapScriptInterface implementation
- ✅ Required function stubs (getDescription, generatePlotTypes, etc.)
- ✅ Placeholder plate tectonic functions
- ✅ Placeholder climate modeling functions
- ✅ Simple circular landmass generation (temporary)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Phase 2)

1. **Plate Tectonic System Implementation**

   - Design plate data structure and initialization
   - Implement basic plate movement simulation
   - Create collision detection and boundary identification
   - Generate elevation maps from plate interactions

2. **Continental Generation**

   - Convert elevation data to plot types (Ocean/Land/Hills/Peaks)
   - Ensure realistic continental shapes
   - Balance landmass distribution for gameplay

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Populate `tests/CvPythonExtensions.py` with mock implementations
   - Create unit tests for plate tectonic algorithms
   - Test map generation with various world sizes

### Technical Implementation Plan

#### Plate Tectonic Algorithm Design

```python
# Planned data structures
plates = [
    {
        'id': int,
        'center': (x, y),
        'velocity': (dx, dy),
        'type': 'oceanic' | 'continental',
        'age': float,
        'density': float
    }
]

# Key functions to implement
def initializePlates(numPlates, mapWidth, mapHeight)
def simulatePlateMovement(plates, iterations)
def calculatePlateInteractions(plates)
def generateElevationFromPlates(plates, mapWidth, mapHeight)
```

#### Performance Considerations

- Target 5-15 plates for standard maps (balance realism vs performance)
- Use simplified physics for plate movement
- Implement efficient collision detection
- Cache expensive calculations where possible

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Algorithm Choices

1. **Plate Count**: Planning 8-12 plates for standard maps

   - Fewer plates = faster generation, less realistic
   - More plates = more realistic, slower generation
   - Will make configurable based on map size

2. **Simulation Iterations**: Planning 50-100 iterations

   - Balance between realism and performance
   - May adjust based on testing results

3. **Elevation Calculation**: Using distance-based influence
   - Each plate influences elevation based on distance and interaction type
   - Convergent boundaries create mountains
   - Divergent boundaries create valleys/ridges

### Design Patterns Established

1. **Configuration Constants**: Define key parameters at file top
2. **Modular Functions**: Keep systems separate despite single file
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to simpler algorithms
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track generation time during development

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization Pattern

```python
# File structure we're following
# 1. Imports and constants
# 2. CvMapScriptInterface functions
# 3. Plate tectonic system functions
# 4. Climate system functions
# 5. Utility functions
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Build one system at a time
2. **Test-Driven**: Create tests before implementing complex algorithms
3. **Visual Validation**: Generate test maps to verify results
4. **Performance First**: Optimize for Civ IV's constraints

### Naming Conventions

- **Interface Functions**: Exact CvMapScriptInterface names
- **Internal Functions**: Descriptive names with system prefixes
- **Constants**: ALL_CAPS configuration values
- **Variables**: camelCase for consistency with Civ IV API

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Civ IV Constraints Understanding

1. **Single File Requirement**: All logic must be in PlanetForge.py
2. **Python 2.4 Compatibility**: Limited language features available
3. **Performance Critical**: Generation time directly impacts user experience
4. **API Limitations**: Must work within CvPythonExtensions constraints

### Map Generation Insights

1. **Realism vs Balance**: Need to balance geological accuracy with gameplay
2. **Emergent Complexity**: Simple rules can create complex, interesting results
3. **User Expectations**: Players expect natural-looking but playable maps
4. **Scalability**: Algorithms must work across all map sizes

### Development Environment Insights

1. **Testing Strategy**: Mock API essential for development outside Civ IV
2. **Visual Debugging**: Map visualization crucial for algorithm validation
3. **Incremental Development**: Build and test one component at a time
4. **Documentation Critical**: Complex algorithms need clear documentation

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges

1. **Performance Optimization**: Balancing realism with generation speed
2. **Algorithm Complexity**: Implementing realistic physics in simplified form
3. **Testing Limitations**: Limited debugging capabilities in Civ IV
4. **Memory Constraints**: Working within Civ IV's memory limits

### Design Challenges

1. **Gameplay Balance**: Ensuring realistic maps are still fun to play
2. **User Interface**: Working within Civ IV's map option constraints
3. **Compatibility**: Supporting all map sizes and game options
4. **Maintainability**: Keeping single file organized and readable
