# Climate System Enhancement Phases

### Phase 3: Validate and Refine Wind-Current Relationships

**Status**: SAVED - To be implemented after Phase 2
**Objective**: Improve wind-current interactions for realistic atmospheric-oceanic coupling
**Key Tasks**:

-   Review wind pattern generation for physical accuracy
-   Implement geostrophic wind-current balance where appropriate
-   Add Ekman transport effects (surface current deflection from wind)
-   Validate coastal upwelling/downwelling patterns
-   Ensure wind and current systems work together realistically

### Phase 4: Improve Rainfall Distribution Logic

**Status**: SAVED - To be implemented after Phase 3
**Objective**: Enhance precipitation patterns based on improved wind and current systems
**Key Tasks**:

-   Refine moisture transport algorithms based on corrected wind and current systems
-   Improve coastal precipitation logic using enhanced ocean-atmosphere interactions
-   Add orographic enhancement for coastal mountain ranges
-   Validate rainfall patterns against corrected wind fields
-   Ensure realistic precipitation gradients from coast to interior
