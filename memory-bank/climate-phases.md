# Climate System Enhancement Phases

## Current Focus: General Refactoring and Cleanup

### Code Health and Maintainability (Completed)

**Status**: DONE - A major refactoring has been completed to improve code quality, reduce duplication, and enhance maintainability.

**Phase 1: Consolidate Configuration and Utilities**

-   ✅ **Rename and Reorganize `MapConstants`**: Renamed `MapConstants.py` to `MapConfig.py` and the class to `MapConfig`.
-   ✅ **Centralize Utilities**: Moved shared utility functions (`normalize_map`, `gaussian_blur`, `Perlin2D`, etc.) from `ElevationMap` and `ClimateMap` into `MapConfig`.
-   ✅ **Audit Parameters**: Reviewed, documented, and reorganized all configuration parameters in `MapConfig` for clarity and logical grouping.
-   ✅ **Refactor Imports**: Updated all scripts to use the new `MapConfig` class.

**Phase 2: Code Cleanup and Optimization**

-   ✅ **Optimize Queues**: Replaced inefficient list-based queues with `collections.deque` in `ClimateMap`.
-   ✅ **Improve Readability**: Cleaned up formatting and added comments to complex sections of the climate generation code.
-   ✅ **Validate Changes**: Ensured all refactoring was validated by the test suite.

**Phase 3: Bug Fixes**

-   ✅ Addressed multiple critical bugs introduced during the refactoring process that affected continent generation and plate tectonics simulation.
-   ✅ Corrected flawed logic in distance and vector calculations that led to `NameError` and `IndexError` exceptions.
-   ✅ Resolved performance regressions caused by the faulty refactoring.

## Saved Climate System Phases (For Future Implementation)

### Phase 2: Fix Temperature-Current Interactions

**Status**: SAVED - To be implemented after ocean current enhancements complete
**Objective**: Improve temperature effects from ocean currents
**Key Tasks**:

-   Fix `_apply_current_temperature_effects()` to use both U and V current components
-   Implement proper heat transport by ocean currents
-   Add warm/cold current temperature effects (Gulf Stream warming, California Current cooling)
-   Validate temperature variation improvements across different climate zones
-   Ensure realistic coastal temperature gradients

### Phase 3: Validate and Refine Wind-Current Relationships

**Status**: SAVED - To be implemented after Phase 2
**Objective**: Improve wind-current interactions for realistic atmospheric-oceanic coupling
**Key Tasks**:

-   Review wind pattern generation for physical accuracy
-   Implement geostrophic wind-current balance where appropriate
-   Add Ekman transport effects (surface current deflection from wind)
-   Validate coastal upwelling/downwelling patterns
-   Ensure wind and current systems work together realistically

### Phase 4: Improve Rainfall Distribution Logic

**Status**: SAVED - To be implemented after Phase 3
**Objective**: Enhance precipitation patterns based on improved wind and current systems
**Key Tasks**:

-   Refine moisture transport algorithms based on corrected wind and current systems
-   Improve coastal precipitation logic using enhanced ocean-atmosphere interactions
-   Add orographic enhancement for coastal mountain ranges
-   Validate rainfall patterns against corrected wind fields
-   Ensure realistic precipitation gradients from coast to interior
