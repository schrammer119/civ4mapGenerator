# Climate System Enhancement Phases

## Current Focus: Ocean Current Model Enhancement

### Ocean Current Enhancement (In Progress)

**Status**: ACTIVE - Implementing enhanced ocean current models for better temperature and climate effects

**Phase 1: Temperature-Gradient Driven Currents**

-   Add temperature gradient calculations to drive north-south current components
-   Enhance `_apply_ocean_current_effects()` to use both U and V components for proper heat transport
-   Create realistic warm/cold current temperature effects

**Phase 2: Coastal Interactions and Basic Depth Effects**

-   Implement coastal current deflection using existing elevation data
-   Add upwelling/downwelling temperature effects based on wind-current interaction
-   Apply depth-based current strength modifications using elevation data as depth proxy

**Phase 3: Integration and Optimization**

-   Integrate all current drivers smoothly without conflicts
-   Optimize performance for acceptable generation times
-   Fine-tune parameters for realistic climate results

## Saved Climate System Phases (For Future Implementation)

### Phase 2: Fix Temperature-Current Interactions

**Status**: SAVED - To be implemented after ocean current enhancements complete
**Objective**: Improve temperature effects from ocean currents
**Key Tasks**:

-   Fix `_apply_current_temperature_effects()` to use both U and V current components
-   Implement proper heat transport by ocean currents
-   Add warm/cold current temperature effects (Gulf Stream warming, California Current cooling)
-   Validate temperature variation improvements across different climate zones
-   Ensure realistic coastal temperature gradients

### Phase 3: Validate and Refine Wind-Current Relationships

**Status**: SAVED - To be implemented after Phase 2
**Objective**: Improve wind-current interactions for realistic atmospheric-oceanic coupling
**Key Tasks**:

-   Review wind pattern generation for physical accuracy
-   Implement geostrophic wind-current balance where appropriate
-   Add Ekman transport effects (surface current deflection from wind)
-   Validate coastal upwelling/downwelling patterns
-   Ensure wind and current systems work together realistically

### Phase 4: Improve Rainfall Distribution Logic

**Status**: SAVED - To be implemented after Phase 3
**Objective**: Enhance precipitation patterns based on improved wind and current systems
**Key Tasks**:

-   Refine moisture transport algorithms based on corrected wind and current systems
-   Improve coastal precipitation logic using enhanced ocean-atmosphere interactions
-   Add orographic enhancement for coastal mountain ranges
-   Validate rainfall patterns against corrected wind fields
-   Ensure realistic precipitation gradients from coast to interior

### Phase 5: Implement Medium-Priority Climate Enhancements

**Status**: SAVED - Long-term enhancements for advanced climate modeling
**Objective**: Add sophisticated climate physics for maximum realism
**Key Tasks**:

-   Thermohaline circulation components for deep ocean effects
-   Enhanced climate feedback mechanisms (ice-albedo, vegetation-climate)
-   More sophisticated cloud physics and atmospheric moisture
-   Seasonal variation effects using position-based pseudo-randomness
-   Advanced climate stability and oscillation patterns

## Implementation Notes

### Testing Strategy

-   Each phase includes testing checkpoints to validate improvements
-   Progressive enhancement ensures each step improves climate modeling
-   Performance monitoring to maintain acceptable generation times
-   Visual validation using test_planetforge.py climate visualization

### Parameter Management

-   All new parameters added to MapConstants.py for centralized management
-   Focus on high-impact parameters that directly affect temperature and precipitation
-   Avoid low-impact complexity that doesn't improve gameplay-relevant climate

### Integration Approach

-   Build on existing climate system without breaking current functionality
-   Maintain Python 2.4 compatibility for Civilization IV
-   Preserve mathematical accuracy and physical realism
-   Ensure all enhancements work together without conflicts

## Priority Rationale

The ocean current enhancement is prioritized because:

1. Ocean currents directly affect coastal and regional temperatures
2. Temperature gradients drive precipitation patterns and moisture transport
3. Realistic temperature patterns lead to better biome placement
4. Ocean heat transport is a major driver of Earth's climate system
5. Current implementation is too simplistic for realistic climate modeling

The saved phases build logically on the ocean current improvements:

-   Phase 2 optimizes the temperature effects from enhanced currents
-   Phase 3 ensures wind-current interactions are physically accurate
-   Phase 4 uses improved temperature and wind patterns for better precipitation
-   Phase 5 adds advanced features for maximum climate realism

This approach ensures steady progress toward a sophisticated, physically accurate climate system while maintaining focus on gameplay-relevant improvements.
