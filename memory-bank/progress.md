    -   Ensured Python 2.4 compatibility for Civilization IV

#### Technical Improvements Made:

**MapConstants.py Architecture:**

1. **Centralized Configuration**:

    - All direction constants (L, N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW) in one location
    - Civilization IV integration with proper CyGlobalContext() handling
    - Organized parameters by category: geological, algorithm, performance
    - Cross-compatibility parameters for ClimateMap integration

2. **Parameter Organization**:

    - `_initialize_civ_settings()` - Civilization IV climate and sea level settings
    - `_initialize_geological_parameters()` - Real-world geological processes
    - `_initialize_algorithm_parameters()` - Plate tectonics and algorithm control
    - `_initialize_performance_parameters()` - Performance and quality trade-offs

3. **Dependency Injection Pattern**:
    - MapConstants handles all Civilization IV API calls
    - Provides map dimensions and wrapping settings
    - Eliminates duplicate parameter definitions across classes

**ElevationMap.py Refactoring:**

1. **Constructor Modernization**:

    - Accepts optional MapConstants instance for dependency injection
    - Removes all parameter initialization methods (80+ parameters moved)
    - Cleaner initialization focused on data structures only

2. **Parameter Reference Updates**:

    - All parameter references updated to use `self.mc.` prefix
    - Direction constants now reference `self.mc.N`, `self.mc.S`, etc.
    - Maintains all existing functionality with improved organization

3. **Code Quality Improvements**:
    - Eliminated 5 large parameter initialization methods
    - Reduced constructor complexity significantly
    - Improved maintainability through centralized configuration
    - Resolved Pylance warnings about undefined symbols

**ClimateMap.py Integration:**

1. **Class Structure**:

    - Proper initialization with elevation_map, terrain_map, map_constants dependencies
    - Organized initialization into `_initialize_climate_parameters()` and `_initialize_data_structures()`
    - Clear separation of concerns between different climate systems

2. **Method Organization**:

    - `GenerateTemperatureMap()` - Complete temperature system with ocean currents
    - `GenerateRainfallMap()` - Comprehensive precipitation modeling
    - `GenerateRiverMap()` - River system framework (placeholder)
    - Utility methods for coordinate handling and validation

3. **Code Quality**:

    - Eliminated repetitive ocean current generation code
    - Created reusable methods for atmospheric circulation patterns
    - Added proper error handling and bounds checking
    - Improved variable naming and documentation

4. **Functionality Preserved**:
    - All original climate modeling algorithms maintained
    - Realistic ocean current patterns based on atmospheric circulation
    - Multi-factor precipitation system (convective, orographic, frontal)
    - Temperature effects from elevation, latitude, and ocean currents
    - Wind pattern generation with mountain blocking effects

#### Complete MapConstants Integration (2025-01-24)

-   **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
-   **Objective**: Complete integration of MapConstants across all map generation classes
-   **Key Achievements**:
    -   Refactored ClimateMap.py to use MapConstants dependency injection
    -   Removed all `getattr()` parameter access patterns in favor of direct `self.mc.` access
    -   Updated PlanetForge.py to create shared MapConstants instance
    -   Integrated ClimateMap into PlanetForge.py generation pipeline
    -   Updated test_planetforge.py with climate system testing and visualization
    -   All classes now use consistent dependency injection pattern

### Next Priority Tasks

#### Integration Phase

1. **PlanetForge.py Integration** ✅ COMPLETED

    - ✅ Integrated cleaned ClimateMap class into main map script
    - ✅ Ensured proper initialization and method calls with shared MapConstants

3. **Performance Optimization**
    - Profile climate generation performance
    - Optimize iterative algorithms where needed
