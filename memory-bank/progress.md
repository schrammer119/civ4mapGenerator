## Current Status: Major Refactoring and Bug Fixing Complete

### Recently Completed (2025-07-27)

-   ✅ **Major Refactoring and Code Cleanup**

    -   Renamed `MapConstants.py` to `MapConfig.py` to better reflect its role as a central configuration and utility hub.
    -   Consolidated all shared utility functions (`normalize_map`, `gaussian_blur`, `Perlin2D`, `get_wrapped_distance`, etc.) into `MapConfig.py` to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.
    -   Audited, documented, and reorganized all configuration parameters within `MapConfig.py` into logical groups (`Elevation`, `Climate`, etc.).
    -   Refactored `ClimateMap.py`, `ElevationMap.py`, `PlanetForge.py`, and `test_planetforge.py` to use the new `MapConfig` class.
    -   Optimized queue usage in `ClimateMap.py` by implementing `collections.deque`.

-   ✅ **Critical Bug Fixes**
    -   Addressed multiple critical bugs introduced during the refactoring process that affected continent generation and plate tectonics simulation.
    -   Corrected flawed logic in distance and vector calculations that led to `NameError` and `IndexError` exceptions.
    -   Resolved performance regressions caused by the faulty refactoring.
    -   The script is now stable and running correctly after manual intervention and fixes.

## Next Development Priorities

### Immediate Tasks

1.  **Continue Climate System Development**: Proceed with the wind, moisture, rain, and biome generation portions of `ClimateMap.py`.
2.  **Validation**: Continue testing with real elevation data and compare to Earth's climate patterns.

### Future Enhancements

1.  **Advanced Ocean Physics**: Upwelling/downwelling effects, seasonal variations.
2.  **Climate Feedback Loops**: Ocean-atmosphere heat exchange.
3.  **River System Enhancement**: Integration with improved climate data.
4.  **Biome Generation**: Use climate data for realistic ecosystem placement.
