# PlanetForge Development Progress

## Completed Features

### Core Map Generation System

-   ✅ **Plate Tectonic Simulation**: Implemented realistic continental plate generation with multiple seeds per continent for complex shapes
-   ✅ **Organic Continent Growth**: Enhanced growth algorithm with anisotropic growth patterns, roughness factors, and distance-based decay
-   ✅ **Plate Velocity Calculation**: Realistic plate motion using hotspot forces, slab pull, plate interactions, and basal drag
-   ✅ **Boundary Detection and Processing**: Advanced tectonic boundary identification with crush/rift/slide classification
-   ✅ **Elevation Generation**: Multi-layered elevation system combining base density, velocity gradients, buoyancy, and boundary effects
-   ✅ **Hotspot Volcanic Activity**: Volcanic mountain chains following plate motion over time with realistic decay patterns
-   ✅ **Map Wrapping Support**: Full support for cylindrical (X-wrap) and toroidal (X+Y wrap) map projections

### Recent Fixes and Improvements

-   ✅ **Wrap-Aware Centroid Calculation** (Latest): Fixed critical issue where continents split by map wrap boundaries had incorrect centroids calculated in the middle of the map instead of at the actual center of the wrapped continent mass
    -   Implemented circular mean calculation treating coordinates as angles on a circle
    -   Replaced simple accumulator approach with proper mathematical handling of wrapping
    -   Updated both primary and secondary seed centroid calculations
    -   Fixed Python 2.4 compatibility issues with non-ASCII characters

### Technical Infrastructure

-   ✅ **Python 2.4 Compatibility**: All code respects Civilization IV's Python 2.4 limitations
-   ✅ **CvMapScriptInterface Integration**: Proper inheritance and function implementation order
-   ✅ **Performance Optimization**: Efficient algorithms suitable for real-time map generation
-   ✅ **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suite with visualization capabilities

## Current Status

The core plate tectonic simulation is complete and functional. The map generator can create realistic continental layouts with proper geological features including mountain ranges, rift valleys, and volcanic chains. The recent fix for wrap-aware centroid calculation ensures that continents spanning map boundaries are handled correctly.

## Next Development Priorities

1. **Climate Modeling**: Implement realistic climate zones based on latitude, elevation, and ocean currents
2. **Terrain Generation**: Add climate-based terrain type assignment (desert, grassland, tundra, etc.)
3. **River Systems**: Create realistic river networks following elevation gradients
4. **Resource Placement**: Implement balanced resource distribution based on geological and climatic factors
5. **Starting Position Balance**: Ensure fair and balanced civilization starting locations

## Technical Debt

-   Some boundary processing could be optimized for very large maps
-   Climate system needs integration with existing elevation data
-   River generation algorithm needs implementation
-   Resource balancing system needs development

## Performance Notes

-   Current generation time is acceptable for standard map sizes
-   Memory usage is within Civilization IV constraints
-   All algorithms scale reasonably with map size
