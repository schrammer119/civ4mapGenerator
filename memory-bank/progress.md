## Current Status

### Active Development

- **Current Phase**: Transitioning from Phase 1 (Complete) to Phase 2 (Core Systems)
- **Next Milestone**: Implement basic plate tectonic simulation
- **Immediate Task**: Design and implement plate initialization algorithm

### Code Quality

- **Architecture**: Clean, modular design within single file constraint
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation and memory bank
- **Testing**: Framework prepared, needs population with actual tests
- **Performance**: Placeholder implementation fast, realistic algorithms TBD

### Technical Debt

- **Placeholder Algorithms**: Simple circular landmass needs replacement
- **Mock API**: Testing framework needs full CvPythonExtensions implementation
- **Performance Unknowns**: Real algorithm performance not yet measured
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and error handling needs testing

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations

1. **Placeholder Generation**: Current landmass generation is too simple
2. **No Climate System**: Terrain assignment uses default algorithms
3. **No Rivers**: River generation falls back to Civ IV defaults
4. **No Resource Logic**: Bonus placement uses default algorithms
5. **Limited Testing**: No comprehensive test suite yet

### Technical Challenges

1. **Performance Constraints**: Must balance realism with generation speed
2. **Memory Limitations**: Working within Civ IV's memory constraints
3. **API Limitations**: Limited debugging and error reporting in Civ IV
4. **Single File Constraint**: All code must fit in one Python file

### Design Challenges

1. **Realism vs Balance**: Balancing geological accuracy with gameplay
2. **Scalability**: Algorithms must work across all map sizes
3. **User Expectations**: Meeting player expectations for natural-looking maps
4. **Compatibility**: Supporting all Civ IV game options and settings

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions (Confirmed)

- **Single File Architecture**: Confirmed as correct approach for Civ IV
- **Plate Tectonic Focus**: Confirmed as viable approach for realistic generation
- **Performance First**: Confirmed as critical constraint
- **Incremental Development**: Confirmed as effective development strategy

### Refined Decisions

- **Plate Count**: Refined to 8-12 plates for standard maps (was 5-15)
- **Simulation Iterations**: Refined to 50-100 iterations (was variable)
- **Testing Strategy**: Refined to focus on visual validation over unit tests
- **Documentation Approach**: Refined to emphasize memory bank over inline docs

### Future Decisions Needed

- **Algorithm Complexity**: How sophisticated should plate physics be?
- **Performance Targets**: What are acceptable generation times?
- **Feature Scope**: Which advanced features are worth implementing?
- **User Options**: Should we add custom map options beyond standard Civ IV?
