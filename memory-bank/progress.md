## Current Understanding

### Map Generation Pipeline

1. **Plot Types** - Basic land/water/hills/peaks layout using fractals
2. **Terrain Types** - Climate-based terrain assignment (grass, desert, etc.)
3. **Features** - Forests, jungles, rivers, and special features
4. **Resources** - Strategic and luxury resource placement
5. **Starting Positions** - Balanced civilization starting locations

### Key Technical Insights

-   **FractalWorld** is the most flexible base architecture
-   **Plate tectonics simulation** creates realistic geological features
-   **Climate modeling** uses physics-based temperature and rainfall
-   **Performance optimization** requires careful fractal parameter tuning
-   **Civ4 API integration** follows established patterns and conventions

### Architecture Decisions

-   Use FractalWorld as foundation for PlanetForge
-   Implement advanced plate tectonics from PerfectWorldS
-   Add realistic climate modeling with ocean currents and wind patterns
-   Support all standard Civ4 map options and settings
-   Optimize for fast generation while maintaining scientific accuracy

## Next Phase: Implementation

### âœ… Core Architecture Implementation

-   [x] Implement basic FractalWorld structure in PlanetForge
-   [x] Add plate tectonics simulation system
-   [x] Create climate modeling framework
-   [x] Integrate terrain and feature generation
-   [x] Add comprehensive testing

### ðŸ”„ Current Task: Bug Fixes and Optimization

-   [x] **Fixed centroid calculation in improved_continent_growth()** - Major bug fix
-   [ ] Performance optimization for large maps
-   [ ] Edge case handling for wrapped maps
-   [ ] Validation of geological accuracy

### ðŸ“‹ Upcoming Tasks

-   [ ] Resource placement algorithms
-   [ ] Starting position optimization
-   [ ] Performance optimization
-   [ ] Integration testing with Civ4
-   [ ] Documentation and user guide

## Technical Specifications

### Mandatory Functions to Implement

```python
def generatePlotTypes():
    # Creates basic land/water/hills/peaks layout
    pass

def generateTerrainTypes():
    # Assigns terrain types based on climate
    pass

def addFeatures():
    # Places forests, jungles, rivers, etc.
    pass
```

### Core Classes Needed

-   **PlanetForge** - Main map generator class
-   **PlateSystem** - Plate tectonics simulation
-   **ClimateModel** - Temperature and rainfall calculation
-   **TerrainMapper** - Terrain type assignment
-   **FeaturePlacer** - Feature placement logic

### Integration Points

-   Game settings (sea level, climate, world size)
-   Map wrapping options (cylindrical, toroidal, flat)
-   Performance constraints (fractal parameters)
-   Civ4 API compatibility (Python 2.4, CvPythonExtensions)

## Development Priorities

1. **Mathematical Accuracy** - Use proper geological and climate models
2. **Performance** - Fast generation for good user experience
3. **Elegance** - Concise, clean code that meets objectives efficiently
4. **Compatibility** - Full Civ4 Python 2.4 API compliance
5. **Balance** - Playable, fair maps for all civilizations
