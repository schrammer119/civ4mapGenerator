## Current Status: Ocean Current Model Corrected and Validated

### Recently Completed (2025-07-26)

-   ✅ **Fixed Ocean Current Anomaly at Map Edges**
    -   Identified and corrected a bug in `_calculate_temperature_gradients()` where the distance vector calculation did not account for map wrapping.
    -   This caused large, artificial temperature gradients at the x-axis edges, leading to unrealistic ocean current spikes.
    -   The fix implements correct wrapping logic for `dx` and `dy`, resolving the anomalies and ensuring proper normalization of ocean currents.
    -   Validated the fix by running the test suite (`test_planetforge.py`) and visually confirming the resolution of the issue.

### Previously Completed

-   ✅ **Ocean Current System Debugging and Correction**
    -   Identified fundamental flaws in the initial pressure-based solver through user feedback.
    -   Created a dedicated test script (`test_ocean_currents.py`) to isolate and debug the ocean current model in a simplified environment.
    -   Corrected the pressure solver by inverting the sign of the face-based forcing term, ensuring forces create high pressure in the direction of flow.
    -   Fixed the velocity calculation to include both the pressure-gradient flux and the external forcing flux, resolving the "source/sink" issue and ensuring flow continuity.
    -   Updated the latitudinal forcing function to `cos(lat) * cos(4*lat)` for more realistic atmospheric cell simulation.
    -   Validated the corrected model, which now produces stable, continuous gyres without unphysical boundary flows.

### Technical Implementation Details

-   **Forcing Generation**: Primary latitude-based forcing is `-cos(lat)*cos(4*lat)`. Secondary forcing from temperature gradients remains.
-   **Solver**: Jacobi iteration solves for a pressure field that balances the external, face-based forces.
-   **Velocity Calculation**: The final velocity is a combination of the pressure-gradient-driven flow, the external force-driven flow, and a post-processing Coriolis rotation. This ensures mass conservation and physical accuracy.
-   **Physical Accuracy**: The model now correctly simulates geostrophic balance where pressure gradients, forcing, and Coriolis effects are in equilibrium.
-   **Performance**: Optimized for Python 2.4 with configurable iteration count and a convergence tolerance.
-   **Integration**: Fully integrated into the `ClimateMap` generation pipeline.

## Next Development Priorities

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Ocean Current Integration**: Enhance interaction with temperature and wind systems
2. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune solver parameters for different map sizes
3. **Validation**: Test with real elevation data and compare to Earth's ocean patterns

### Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Ocean Physics**: Upwelling/downwelling effects, seasonal variations
2. **Climate Feedback Loops**: Ocean-atmosphere heat exchange
3. **River System Enhancement**: Integration with improved climate data
4. **Biome Generation**: Use climate data for realistic ecosystem placement

## Architecture Notes

### Design Principles Maintained

-   **Mathematical Accuracy**: All ocean current physics based on real oceanographic principles
-   **Performance Optimization**: Efficient algorithms suitable for game engine constraints
-   **Concise and Elegant**: Clean, maintainable code following project standards
-   **Python 2.4 Compatibility**: All code respects Civilization IV constraints

### Key Technical Decisions

-   Steady-state solver chosen over time-stepping for performance.
-   **Face-based forcing** used to correctly model uniform driving forces (e.g., wind stress).
-   **Coriolis effect applied as a post-processing, divergence-free flux rotation**, which is computationally efficient and physically sound.
-   Equal-weight neighbour connectivity for simplicity.
-   Temperature-driven thermal circulation as a secondary forcing mechanism.
